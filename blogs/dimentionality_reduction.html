					   Introduction
					   <h3>

						   <p class="paragraphFontStyle"> Most people get instant headlines from Twitter. In doing so, certain trends or hashtags take over the social media platform. But why does this happen? What factors contribute to the rise and fall of a hashtag? What is the trajectory of a trend on twitter look like? and how long do these trends last? These are the main questions addressed in this research. I try to analyze the reasons why topics trend on twitter, the rate at which a hashtag trends by considering factors such as users’ interests, users’ connections/relationships, trending information provided by the social media platform. The theme of the project is not only to study the effect of these factors on a hashtag’s lifecycle but also determine when, if any, in the life-cycle of a hashtag their effect is pronounced and also how they affect the hashtag’s lifecycle.  </p>

						   <p class="paragraphFontStyle">The end-goal of the research is to determine the likelihood that a hashtag would take off and become popular, the rate at which a hashtag will rise and also the rate at which it’s popularity will fall. The entire project is divided into two parts: the rise of a hashtag and the decline of a hashtag. </p>


						   <h3 style="font-weight:500;" class="blog-subtitles"> Data collection and processing
							   <h3>

								   <p class="paragraphFontStyle"> All data being used for the research is collected with the use of Twitter’s REST and Stream APIs. The collected datasets have location and time constraints to ensure consistency. Currently, the data is collected only for the Illinois region. The following are the type of datasets retrieved through Twitter’s APIs:</p>

								   <div class="listItemFonts">
									   <ol class="">
										   <li class="paragraphFontStyle "><strong>User Information: </strong> Users and information about users such as their profile were collected using Twitter’s Rest API, specifically the GET User/show endpoint. Since the Twitter API does not provide an API for retrieving a list of users, random IDs were generated and a user object was retrieved using their API.
										   </li>


										   <li class="paragraphFontStyle "><strong> Tweet Information: </strong>
											   Tweets were collected using the Twitter’s Stream API instead of their REST API. This was to ensure that we collected a comprehensive set of tweets instead of just taking a sample of tweets. A stream of tweets was collected for the Illinois region for the users collected through their REST API
										   </li>
										   <li class="paragraphFontStyle "><strong> Trends
											    </strong>The aim was to make the trends consistent with the tweet information we have. So, after collecting a day’s worth of tweet’s, trending hashtags were collected through Twitter’s REST API, specifically the GET trends/location and GET trends/places endpoints.  Once the top trending hashtags were retrieved by the end of the day, one hashtag is picked so that its lifecycle can be analyzed.
										   </li>

									   </ol>
								   </div>


								   <p class="paragraphFontStyle"> Once all the required data is collected and parsed, a social graph is created to represent the relationship among user objects. The source of the selected hashtag is also determined by going through collected tweets and analyzing the time of the tweets. </p>

								   <h3 style="font-weight:500;" class="blog-subtitles">
									   Current State of the project and moving forward
									   <h3>

								   <p class="paragraphFontStyle"> How fast a hashtag is rising or falling is determined by analyzing the rate of usage of the hashtag within a 24-hour period. Once the source of the hashtag is determined, the analysis involves observing the path of the trending hashtag through the graph. We analyze and study each involved user with respect to the state of the hashtag at that point by analyzing the following:</p>
										   <div class="listItemFonts">
											   <ol class="">
												   <li class="paragraphFontStyle ">
													   How <strong>“important”</strong> a user is and how many “important” connections the user has at the current state of the hashtag. Importance is defined a combination of a user’s demonstrated interest in the hashtag, which is determined through analysis of user’s tweets and profile and connections, and also how well connected that user is to other similar users. This will help determine what features of a user determine how a hashtag flows and also user’s relationship to the rate of the rise or fall of a hashtag.
												   </li>


												   <li class="paragraphFontStyle ">
													   What’s <strong>trending </strong>at that point? The goal is to analyze how trending information influences people’s use of a hashtag and the rate of a hashtag’s rise or decline at various points along the lifecycle of a hashtag..
												   </li>
												   <li class="paragraphFontStyle ">
													   How many times does the average user <strong>reuse the same hashtag</strong>. This will be analyzed in conjunction with the importance of a user. If you’re connected to a user who is considered important but that user has already used the hashtag, that user may not contribute much to the fast rise of the hashtag. So, knowing how many times a user is likely to use a hashtag will help determine the path and rate of the hashtag’s rise/fall.
												   </li>

											   </ol>
