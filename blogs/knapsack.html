I will explore problems that boil down to one of the two forms of the subset problem. I will use the knapsack problem to explain and provide a recurrence relationship to solve other similar types of problems. In this blog, I assume a certain amount of familiarity in dealing with recurrence relationships and very basic dynamic programming.

There are several types of problems that can be reduced to the knapsack problem, or more generally an optimization of a subset problem where the order of the subsets is irrelevant. </p>

                            What is the Knapsack problem?
                            <h3>

                                <p class="paragraphFontStyle">The knapsack problem is all about getting the best value out of resources at hand. You’re given a set of resources (gold in this case), and the goal is to find a subset of the resources such that you maximize the value you get out of the resources. If the subset of gold pieces we have maximize the value we get, we don’t care in what order the gold pieces come. Problems of this type are the focus of this blog. Another way to think of such type of problems would be to think of them as a way of utilizing one’s resources with an intent and a target or a constraint to bound the problem. This will be the definition I will be following throughout the rest of the blog. Now there are a lot of things to unpack in the later definition. So, let’s look at the definition more in depth. </p>

                                <p class="paragraphFontStyle"> First thing we need to look at is the word ‘resources’.
                                    In the context of this problem, we can define a resource to be either any
                                    <strong> physical or abstract object </strong> that we can use in some way such as
                                    gold or time or a
                                    <strong> decision/action </strong>we can take such as the decision to take one step
                                    or two steps on a stair. We can have either a finite or an infinite amount of
                                    resources for our problem. So, we need to be able to identify not only the type of
                                    resources we have but also the amount of each type of resource we’re using when
                                    working on problem. In other words, we need to ask ourselves, ‘does the problem
                                    limit the amount of resources we have? Or are we allowed to repeatedly use the same
                                    resource?’. We’ll see how this term and others fit practically later when we go
                                    through examples.
                                </p>


                                <p class="paragraphFontStyle"> The second term we need to deconstruct is the term target
                                    or constraint. Any knapsack problem will usually involve a target or a bound in
                                    which the entire problem is confined in. For example, in the generic example of a
                                    knapsack problem, we see that there is a limit to how much gold the knapsack can
                                    hold. This limit is what we would consider to be the constraint or the target. </p>

                                <p class="paragraphFontStyle"> The third term to look at is the word ‘intent’. When
                                    working with the knapsack problem, our intent is going to be either one of the
                                    following: </p>


                                <div class="listItemFonts">

                                        <li class="paragraphFontStyle ">Maximize the value of the way we use our finite
                                            resources

                                            resources(finite or infinite)
                                        </li>
                                    </ol>
                                </div>


                                <p class="paragraphFontStyle"> These five points are just more specific cases of the 2 cases of the subset problem we defined at the beginning of this blog. So, when we are working with any knapsack problem, what we do within the problem will be either one of the five points above. The form that a knapsack problem takes will depend on what our intent is.</p>

                                <p class="paragraphFontStyle"> This brings us to the last two terms we need to define which are not explicitly in the definition: value and cost. Whenever we want to determine the cost of each resource in a knapsack problem, a good question to ask would be ‘What is the cost of each type of resource with respect to the target or constraint?’ Similarly, to figure out the value of each resource, we ask ourselves ‘What value does each resource have with respect your intent or what you’re trying to achieve?’</p>

                                <p class="paragraphFontStyle"> Now that we have defined all the necessary terms needed to understand the problem, we will see how these terms fit in a more practical context and formulate recurrence relationships for the five forms of the problem mentioned above by using the knapsack problem.  </p>

                                    Problem 1: Stealing gold from a bank
                                    <h3>

                                        <p class="paragraphFontStyle"> This is, by far, the most famous example of the type of problems we’ll be covering. The general idea of the problem is as follows: Thieves enter a bank holding a knapsack with the intent of taking gold from the bank. However, they soon encounter a problem. Each piece of gold has a weight and a distinct value associated with it. Their goal is get the most value from all the gold they can carry with their knapsack. The knapsack has a maximum weight limit and each piece of gold has a weight and a corresponding value.  </p>

                                        <p class="paragraphFontStyle"> A good way to identify weather or not a problem falls under the types of subset problems we’re describing is to see if it is asking us to combine or use the resources that we have (gold in this case) to achieve our goal (maximizing the value gold) or to get to your target (get as close to the weight limit as possible while getting more value). If you’re able to frame your problem this way, then you can solve the problem using one of the five forms of the knapsack problem discussed above. Once you know it falls under the constraints we set above, identify the key terms within the problem: </p>


                                        <p class="paragraphFontStyle"><strong> Resources: </strong> our resource is gold
                                            here. Our problem will differ depending on weather we have a finite or
                                            infinite amount of gold. First, let’s first assume we have in infinite
                                            supply of all the available gold. This means we can repeatedly put the same
                                            type of gold into our knapsack if we think it will provide us with the
                                            optimal solution. </p>

                                        <p class="paragraphFontStyle"><strong> Intent: </strong> Maximize the value of
                                            gold we put into our knapsack</p>

                                        <p class="paragraphFontStyle"><strong> Target/Constraint: </strong> our problem
                                            is limited or bounded by the weight that the knapsack can hold. The maximum
                                            weight the knapsack can hold will be our target. </p>

                                        <p class="paragraphFontStyle"><strong> Cost: </strong> let’s ask ourselves the
                                            following question: ‘What is the cost of each gold with respect to the
                                            target (weight limit)?’ We can see that the weight of each individual gold
                                            item is the cost of the gold items since that will affect the overall
                                            available weight limit we have within the knapsack. In other words, the more
                                            gold we put into the knapsack the less available space we will have. </p>

                                            Recurrence Relationship
                                            <h3>

                                                <p class="paragraphFontStyle"> Now let’s try to come up with a
                                                    recurrence relationship to solve this scenario. It seems like the
                                                    more pieces of gold we put into the knapsack, the available space
                                                    decreases. However, since we’re assuming first that we have an
                                                    infinite supply of gold, the amount of gold we have does not
                                                    decrease as we keep putting more pieces into our knapsack. So, it
                                                    seems like the what we are trying to do depends on the amount of
                                                    available weight we have within the knapsack. So, let’s define our
                                                    recurrence relationship in terms of the amount of remaining weight
                                                    ‘W’. Let’s say K[W] is the maximum value we can get if we have an
                                                    infinite supply of gold and a knapsack of capacity W. </p>

                                                <p class="paragraphFontStyle"> Now that we’ve defined what our problem
                                                    is, let’s imagine that we’ve put some pieces of gold into our
                                                    knapsack in an optimal way and we have W amount of weight left. If
                                                    we are sure that we have put the right types of gold in so far, the
                                                    next best move to make would be to put in the gold piece that gives
                                                    us the maximum value. Let’s look at the recurrence relationship
                                                    below. If we assume that we have an infinite supply of N distinct
                                                    types of gold:
                                                </p>

                                                <p class="paragraphFontStyle"> This is the recurrence relationship that
                                                    will help us solve this specific situation of the knapsack
                                                    problem. </p>

                                                    supply of different types of gold, then the situation becomes a bit
                                                    different. As we put more gold items into our knapsack, not only
                                                    does the amount of available space decrease, but we can no longer
                                                    repeat and put the same type of gold we had put into our knapsack
                                                    earlier. This is because we don’t have an infinite supply of each
                                                    type of gold. As a result, we need to definite our recurrence

                                                    have a knapsack of capacity W. If we again imagine that we’ve put
                                                    some distinct pieces of gold into our knapsack in an optimal way and

                                                    consider the ith gold, we are either going to put that gold in the

                                                    gold, regardless of weather it is finite or infinite. The recurrence

                                                    limit of W, the next option you’ll face is weather the ith gold will

                                                    be filled with the other remaining pieces of gold. We simply then
