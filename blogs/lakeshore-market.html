                    Lakeshore Market: E-commerce on-campus

                <h3 style="font-weight:500;" class="blog-subtitles">
                    Introduction
                    <h3>

                        <p class="paragraphFontStyle"> Lakeshore marketplace is a system that provides e-commerce
                            related web service APIs exclusively for students of Loyola University Chicago’s lake shore
                            campus. It lets students buy anything that is up for sale by other students by providing
                            services like other e-commerce sites except that the features here are tailored specifically
                            to this niche. </p>

                        <h3 style="font-weight:500;" class="blog-subtitles">
                            Motivation
                            <h3>

                                <p class="paragraphFontStyle"> At the moment, when students want to engage in the
                                    buying/selling process involving things such as used books, room items and others,
                                    students usually post it on a Facebook page which can go wrong in many ways. For
                                    example, students who need the product might not see the post around the time it is
                                    posted on Facebook. There is also no way for students to search for advertised
                                    products on the Facebook page. Facebook was meant to be used for a lot of things but
                                    e-commerce was not one of them. This project aims to solve these issues and others
                                    associated with the current way students engage in buying/selling of products
                                    on-campus. </p>


                                <p class="paragraphFontStyle"> So, after initially working on a project that was
                                    supposed to be a regular e-commerce system whose functionalities are exposed through
                                    RESTful web APIs, I spoke with my professor about the possibility of pivoting the
                                    project in a direction that fits within the context of an on-campus marketplace, and
                                    he ended up being very supportive of the idea. </p>


                                <h3 style="font-weight:500;" class="blog-subtitles">
                                    How does it work?
                                    <h3>

                                        <p class="paragraphFontStyle"> When someone wants to sell some new or used
                                            product, they will sign up for an account and then add the product they want
                                            to sell. From a buyer’s perspective, the user has the option to search for a
                                            specific product, or they can simply pick from a filtered list of products
                                            based on popularity or how recently the products were added. </p>

                                        <p class="paragraphFontStyle"> Users will select a default payment method upon
                                            registration. Payment validation and processing is handled with the use of
                                            Braintree’s APIs. Once an order has been verified and ordered, the seller
                                            will be notified of the order and will also be provided with delivery
                                            location services by using Google’s Map API. Since this is specifically made
                                            for students that live on or near Loyola University’s lakeshore campus,
                                            delivery is usually just a matter of travelling from one point on campus to
                                            another. </p>


                                        <h3 style="font-weight:500;" class="blog-subtitles">
                                            How can it be used?
                                            <h3>

                                                <p class="paragraphFontStyle"> All the necessary functionalities are
                                                    offered as REST web service APIs. Another person will be working on
                                                    designing and creating a view that utilizes the services provided in

                                                    <h3>

                                                        <p class="paragraphFontStyle"> At a higher level, the project
                                                            was designed in 3 separate layers with high emphasis placed
                                                            on decoupling and coherence of the system. This is mainly
                                                            achieved by modularizing our code and using various
                                                            principles such as dependency inversion, open-closed
                                                            principle and single responsibility principles. Various
                                                            design patterns have also been used to represent repeated
                                                            design elements. The three layers used in the design of the
                                                            program are the service layer, domain layer, and data access
                                                            layer. The service layer is a structure built using Java and
                                                            CXF running on Apache’s tomcat server. The domain layer is
                                                            written in java and uses ReactiveX Java to manage
                                                            asynchronous tasks and uses spring to manage dependency
                                                            injection. This makes testing easier and minimizes code
                                                            modifications when adding new features. The data access
                                                            layer uses hibernate to persist objects into a MySQL
                                                            database server. At various stages in the design process, we
                                                            were iteratively modifying our designs. </p>
