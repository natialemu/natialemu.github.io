                    Introduction
                    <h3>

                        <p class="paragraphFontStyle"> Lakeshore-market is a RESTful web service that provides students
                            at a university with e-commerce functionalities. It lets students buy anything that is up
                            for sale by other students. It is basically amazon tailored specifically to Loyola’s
                            niche. </p>

                        <h3 style="font-weight:500;" class="blog-subtitles animated fadeIn mb-3">
                            Motivation
                            <h3>

                                <p class="paragraphFontStyle"> There are certain items that students feel like putting
                                    up for sale for other students to buy. Some students might like to sell a book they
                                    no longer need or other items from their room they won’t use. Whatever the reason
                                    may be, the current way students are able to engage in such type of activities is
                                    through posts on Facebook page known as Loyola Buy/sell. There are a lot of things
                                    that make this method quite inconvenient. For example, let’s assume there is a post
                                    asking if anyone is interested in buying a theology book. After about a week or so,
                                    a student might go to the page but may not find the old post even if the student
                                    would have been interested in the theology book. There is also no way for students
                                    to filter or search for posts that contain a product of interest on the Facebook
                                    page. The goal of this project is to solve these issues and provide functionalities
                                    that will make e-commerce among students on campus a lot more convenient than it
                                    currently is. </p>


                                <h3 style="font-weight:500;" class="blog-subtitles animated fadeIn mb-3">
                                    Higher level description of the project
                                    <h3>

                                        <p class="paragraphFontStyle"> Both sellers and buys will need to have an
                                            existing account which is active to use the services provided. When students
                                            want to sell a new or used product, they will sign up for an account and
                                            then add the product to their inventory. They can also choose to modify an
                                            existing product in their inventory. From a buyer’s perspective, the user
                                            has the option to filter or search for available products via multiple
                                            parameters. Once buyers have selected the appropriate products, they can
                                            place an order. Everything from managing transactions, validating and
                                            assembling order content, and validating payment is handled by the server as
                                            soon as the user places an order. The web service also provides
                                            functionalities for managing accounts of both Sellers and buyers. </p>

                                        <p class="paragraphFontStyle"> By using the API endpoints, the client can
                                            integrate ways for the user to view most popular or trending products,
                                            highest rated products and/or recently added products by sellers. The The
                                            exclusivity of the service to only a specific school makes it easier for
                                            students to discover things they’re more likely to find appealing by
                                            filtering products by ratings, popularity, or date. Once an order has been
                                            placed, the seller will be notified of the order and will also be provided
                                            with delivery location services by using Google’s Map API. A sample
                                            lakeshore client has been deigned and implemented that utilizes the
                                            lakeshore market web service APIs to provide an e-commerce service to
                                            exclusively Loyola University Chicago students. </p>

                                                <p class="paragraphFontStyle"> The project was designed in four main
                                                    phases. We started off by first going through various use cases: the
                                                    buying experience, the seller/buyer registration. We identified key
                                                    vocabularies to start off the design of our domain layer. We wanted
                                                    to start our design with the most essential features but leave room
                                                    for extensions such as review system management, recommendation
                                                    systems and providing sales history and statistics. We continued to
                                                    work on the design with maintainability and extensibility in mind.
                                                    Once we had a stable domain layer design, we started working on an
                                                    ER Schema for our database based on the domain layer design we set
                                                    up. We then moved on to the second phase of our development
                                                    process.</p>

                                                <p class="paragraphFontStyle"> The second phase involved designing and
                                                    implementing the service layer of the system. We had to walk through
                                                    the uses cases in detail again to identify the key endpoints we
                                                    needed to expose and to identify the right type and number of
                                                    representation and request classes to incorporate into our service
                                                    layer design. We wanted to make sure that our project was at Level 2
                                                    of The Richardson Maturity model at the end of this phase.</p>

                                                <p class="paragraphFontStyle"> In the third phase of the project, we
                                                    implemented HAETOAS which involved thinking of all possible next
                                                    steps the client could take after making a request. In the final
                                                    phase the project, we designed and implement a web client that
                                                    utilizes the REST web service.</p>
