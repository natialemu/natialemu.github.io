                    Introduction
                    <h3>


                        <p class="paragraphFontStyle">Recommendation systems have become an integral products in most
                            industries. It provides a way for companies to better interact with their clients by pushing
                            personalized content to their clients, especially now that machine learning is being used to
                            better predict user's preferences. In this blog, I will try to explain how to build a movie
                            recommendation
                            system that makes use of a combination of content based filtering and collaborative-based
                            filtering. </p>

                            Data collection and processing
                            <h3>


                                <p class="paragraphFontStyle"> Data used for this project was primarily collected by
                                    GroupLens research
                                    from the Movielens website. The dataset consists of information on IMDB movies,
                                    their ratings, and
                                    the users who rated the movies. This information was enough to create a machine
                                    learning model that
                                    learns users’ preferences as well features for each movie. There were two groups of
                                    datasets used
                                    for this dataset: a large dataset and a small dataset. For computational reasons,
                                    the large dataset
                                    was split into two separate groups with each one being split by a 7:10 ratio to be
                                    used for training
                                    and the remaining one fourth of the dataset used for testing split into test and
                                    development set by
                                    a 1:2 ratio.</p>

                                        <p class="paragraphFontStyle">A feature vector, X, for movie of dimension n
                                            represents how much of the
                                            movie belongs to the nth genre. For example, if we’re creating a feature
                                            vector of size 3, first
                                            entry might provide information about how comedic the movie was, the second
                                            might provide
                                            information about how romantic the movie is and so forth. This feature
                                            vector, X, along with the
                                            users’ preference of genere, Theta, will be learned by the algorithm
                                            simultaneously. Before delving
                                            deep into how the model for this system works, let’s look at what
                                            Content-based filtering and
                                            collaborative based filtering are. </p>

                                                    filtering: </strong>The assumption we’re
                                                    making here when using this approach is that we know about the set
                                                    of features of the movie.
                                                    That is, we know how comedic, romantic, action or horror a movie is.
                                                    Based on these
                                                    features, our goal is to predict how a user would rate a movie by
                                                    learning a user’s interest
                                                    in a genre. The following image illustrates the problem formulation:

                                                <p>Our goal is then to minimize the above objective function using

                                                    of the movies are. What
                                                    we have instead is how much each user loves a certain genre of a
                                                    movie. We’re going to use
                                                    that information to learn the feature vector and predict user

                                                    are collaborating to get better movie ratings for everyone else.
                                                    It’s this sense of
                                                    collaboration that gives it the name collaborative filtering. The

                                            or just the parameters,
                                            our model learns both at the same time. What the model does is initialize

                                                    feature vector. We’ll need to compute the dot product of the feature

                                                    ranked by their average similarity to the movies in set S”. Once we
                                                    get this collection of movies,
                                                    the top ranked movies will be recommended to the user. </p>
