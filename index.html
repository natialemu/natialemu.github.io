One approach, in terms of implementation, is to set up a system such that the computer learns from its own decisions, and how those affected the outcome without the need for data input. The approach used in this program, however, involved using existing data to inform the decisions of the computers. One way data was collected for the program was by playing the game on a regular basis and recording the combination of key presses and the outcome during each game.",
		   paragraph2:"The program uses perceptron and KNN in order to learn how to play the game from the user. There are four keys used to determine the direction of the game: W, S, A, D which are the classes the algorithm predicts by using each cell on the board as a feature.
