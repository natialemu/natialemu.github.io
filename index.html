		   ModalSubImage1: "gitletWug.png",
		   paragraph2: "Gitlet is implemented by using a tree in which a node only has a reference to its parent. Each node in the tree represents a single commit. One feature of the commit tree that it is in some sense immutable: once a commit node has been created, it can never be destroyed(or changed at all). Each path within the tree will represent a branch, while the tail node on each branch will represent the most recent commit on that branch.",
	       paragraph3: "All copies of files and other metadata are stored in a folder called .gitlet. A gitlet system is considered initialized in a particular location if it has the .gitlet folder there. The default location where a gitlet system will be initialized is in a folder named workingDirectory in root of the project, unless specified otherwise. State of the data structures used to store information about commits is persisted using Java’s serializable interface.  The settings are serialized on to a file within the .gitlet folder. Here are a few of the commands available on gitlet and their differences from git:",
		   paragraph4: "Initialize: Creates a new gitlet version control system in the current directory. This system will automatically start with one commit: a commit that contains no files and has the commit message initial commit.",
		   Paragraph4LeftMargin: "50px;",
		   paragraph5: "Add: Indicates you want the file to be included in the upcoming commit as having been changed. Adding a file is also called staging the file. If the file had been marked for removal, instead just unmark it.  In Gitlet, if a file is added, then modified, then committed, the contents of the file at the time of the commit command are recorded (not the contents at the time of add). By contrast, in Git, if a file is added, then modified, then committed, the contents of the file at the time of the add command are recorded (not the contents at the time of commit).

For one, if git doesn't run into any merge conflicts, it will automatically create a new commit for you at the end, but gitlet does not. In git, this new commit at the end of merge is special, because it maintains two back pointers remembering which two branches it came from. But gitlet only maintains one normal back pointer on the current branch.",

A continental divide is a geographical term for the boundary which divides a continent into parts where each part leads to a different body of water. A clever way to think about a continental divide is to imagine rain pouring down on an entire continent. The water in each of the various parts made by the divide would flow to a different body of water. The application also handles situations where a part of a landmass will have water flow into a lake. For example, in Africa, the continental divide splits the continent in three parts, without assuming flow of water into lakes:",

It’s an algorithm that’s pretty good at generating realistic looking terrain. It works on a 2D array that’s 2n+1 square and will need to have the four corners of the original array to have a value set before it starts. The algorithm first sets the center point by averaging the four corner values and adding a small random amount of noise. This step is called the diamond step. The next step of the algorithm is set the four mid points between each corner. After recursively repeating the first two steps for each square that is formed, a realistic looking terrain will be generated.",

So it can be used by any facility that ranges anywhere from just a single unit to a vast compound or even more. The purpose of the facility being managed is also irrelevant for the program. This is mainly achieved by using the composite design pattern. Inspectors and staff members are implemented with the use of the visitor design pattern",

It will be responsible for managing the services such as adding/removing the service, determining who can use or is eligible to use the service, the cost of the service and more. ",
