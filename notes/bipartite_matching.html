                                                    This is important because a lot of combinatorics problems can be represented as bipartite graphs 
                                                    and solved by matching algorithms. So by reducing matching algorithms to network flow algorithms, 
                                                    it is possible to efficiently solve complex combinatorics problems.

                                                        Assignment problems  are one class of problems that can be solved via bipartite matching. 
                                                        Assume there are 'N' workers, and 'M' machines. Not all of the 'N' workers know how to 
                                                        operate every machine, and not every machine can be operated by all employees. 
                                                        The goal is to assign workers to machines & minimize the overall number of 
                                                        idle machines and employees while doing so.

                                                        The goal is to find the maximum number of bishops that can be placed on an NxN chessboard without 
                                                        any two bishop pieces attacking each other.

                                                        This problem can be split into two sub problems: One for bishops that move along dimensions that span only white cells and one for bishops move on dimensions that span black cells. 
                                                        This is because bishops in alternating colored cells will never attack each other. So these two problems can be solved independently.

                                                            negative slope. Bishops will only attack each other if they share either one of the slopped dimensions. 
                                                            So the goal is to place bishops in such a way that they are placed in cells that don't share a
