                                                        A 'bipartite matching' is a set of edges in a bipartite graph that have 
                                                        exclusive ownership of the pair of vertices each edge in the matching connects.

                                                        which is the minimum set of vertices that spans every edge in the graph.

                                                    be matched to some uncolored vertex and vice versa. There are two main pre-requisites

                                                    it is possible to efficiently solve complex combinatorics problems.

                                                        Another problem that can efficiently be solved via bipartite matching is the N-Bishops problem. 
                                                        The goal is to find the maximum number of bishops that can be placed on an NxN chessboard without 
                                                        any two bishop pieces attacking each other.    
                                                 </p>

                                                    <p class="paragraphFontStyle">  
                                                        This problem can be split into two sub problems: One for bishops that move along dimensions that span only white cells and one for bishops move on dimensions that span black cells. 
                                                        This is because bishops in alternating colored cells will never attack each other. So these two problems can be solved independently. 

                                                        
                                                    </p>

                                                    <p class="paragraphFontStyle">
                                                            A cell that a bishop is placed on is an intersection of two diagonal lines in which one has positive slope and the other has 
                                                            negative slope. Bishops will only attack each other if they share either one of the slopped dimensions. 
                                                            So the goal is to place bishops in such a way that they are placed in cells that don't share a 
                                                            positive slopped or negative slopped line.

                                                            represent the negative slopped dimensions that span the board. There is an edge between alternating 
                                                            colored vertices to represent a cell. So if there is an edge between v and w, that represents
                                                             the cell formed by the intersection of vertical dimension v and horizontal dimension w.

                                                            Placing rooks in cells(edges) that are in a matching will guarantee that they won't 
                                                            attach each other since those edges do not share either dimension. So the maximum matching in this 
                                                            case will represent the maximum number of "safe" cells to place bishops on.

                                                            Another way to solve the problem would be to rotate the board by 45 degrees. 
                                                            By doing so, bishops in this new rotated board will behave as rooks. Solving this version of the problem via bipartite matching may require less overhead.

                                                            bipartite matching. The key thing here is the fact that a queen is essentially a combination of a rook & a bishop. So, the problem can be divided into a bishop sub problem and 
                                                            a rook sub-problem. These two subproblems can be combined after each one is solved independently. When combining the solutions to the two sub-problems, the important
