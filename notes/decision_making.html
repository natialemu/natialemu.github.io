                                                    A recursive data type is one that's composed of objects of the exact same type. 
                                                    One helpful analogy would be to think of Russian dolls.

                                                        until the last piece of Russian doll which is the smallest doll.

                                                    From a more technical perspective, Linked structures such as linked lists 
                                                    trees, graphs are some common examples of recursive data types. This is because
                                                     a single node in these structures points to(is composed of) one or more nodes of
                                                      the exact same type. The relationship between the nodes in these structures is 
                                                      explicitly defined so it's easier to see how they fit in.

                                                            To recap, the structures that exhibit these 'chained' behaviors are known as
                                                             recursive data types while the main algorithm that manipulates and traverses the

                                                              the remaining note will look at examples of problems whose structures resemble 
                                                              that of recursive data types.

                                                            The first example is a problem involving subsets. Given a set of elements, what does it mean 
                                                            to find its subsets? Finding all subsets is just a matter of going through each element of the 
                                                            set and deciding if that element should go into the subset or not. Once every element has been 
                                                            decided upon, the elements in the subset make up one solution. However, a different a set of
                                                             decisions on the elements of the set may result in a different subset at the end. So, one way of 
                                                             encapsulating this problem that changes its state based on the applied decision is using the 
                                                             following definition:

                                                            Every time a decision is made on an element, a new instance of the problem is created. Maybe this 
                                                            new instance will have an additional element in its subset or it may not. The decision tree, 
                                                            along with the state of the instances, is shown below:

                                                        It's easier to see, in the picture above, how the subset problem defined above can be encapsulated 
                                                        as a recursive structure. In fact, it really just looks like a binary tree where each node represents 
                                                        an instance of the problem, and the edges represent the decision taken to convert the problem from 
                                                        one state to another.

                                                            Representing problems as recursive structures is the first step. It's equally important to traverse 
                                                            and manipulate these structures to get to a solution of the problem. There are generally two ways to
                                                             traverse such type of structures: <a id="externalLink" href="linked_structures.html">Breadth first traversal</a> and 
                                                             <a id="externalLink" href="linked_structures.html">Depth-first traversal</a>. 
                                                             In this case, traversing the structure means exploring different states of the problem. 
                                                             Notice how all the instances that are leaves of the tree structure represent all the possible subsets
                                                              of the original set. So, if the goal is to find all the subsets, the solution would be to traverse 
                                                              the tree and return all the nodes. If the goal is to find the subset with the most sum, the solution
                                                               is still going to be one of the leaves. Regardless, the key to the solution is still somehow 
                                                               traversing the structure.

                                                    Another example is the N-Queens problem. Given an N by N Board, the goal is to decide where to put N queens on the board so that none of the queens attack each other.
                                                     For ease of visualization, let N be 4. The first move involves placing the first queen somewhere on one of the 16 cells of the chess board. Given that decision 
                                                     is made, the state of the board will change, and there will be 15 empty cells left on the board. Here is one way of encapsulating the problem:
                                                </p>

                                                <img src="../images/chessboard_class.jpg" style=" width: 40%;"/>




                                     


                                                <p class="paragraphFontStyle"> 
                                                    Every move will transition the board from one state to another linking related board states, and very much like the subset problem, it will form a tree structure 
                                                    where the nodes represent states or instances of the board and the edges represent moves that result in state transitions. So, the visual representation of this
                                                     problem resembles that of a recursive data type. Leaves of this structure represent states where all N queens have been placed. Some of the leaves may be ones where
                                                      the queens don't attack each other. So, to solve this problem, traversing the tree recursive structure to get to the desired leaf nodes is key.

                                                </p>

                                      

                                                <p class="paragraphFontStyle"> 
                                                    In some instances, simply traversing all the nodes of recursive data types may be unnecessary. So, there are 'smarter' approaches that optimize the traversal algorithm. 
                                                    One technique is called <a id="externalLink" href="https://developers.google.com/optimization/cp">constraint programming</a>. In constraint programming, the idea is to constrain the number of new states that can 
                                                    arise from the current state based on what is known about the current state of a problem. For example, if the first queen is placed on the top left corner of the chess 
                                                    board, the algorithm should avoid placing the next queen on any of the crossed out cells shown below since that will lead to two queens attacking each other.  
                                                    So, those new potential board states should not even be an option, and the algorithm should determine that based on the current move it is making.                                          
                                               </p>

                                                    Similarly, while traversing recursive structures, the recursive algorithm may encounter the same sub-problem again. Instead of having to re-compute the solution to 
                                                    those subproblems, it's better to save the solution the first time the problem's solution is computed. Then, the next time the algorithm encounters the same instance 
                                                    and is about to make the same set of decisions, it would know the outcome immediately without having to do additional work to compute the solution. This technique of 
                                                    optimizing such type of situations is called <a id="externalLink" href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs97si/04-dynamic-programming.pdf">dynamic programming</a>.
