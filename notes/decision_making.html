                                                <p class="paragraphFontStyle"> Imagine playing with a rubics cube.
                                                        At any point, while trying to solve the cube, we have to decide how to rotate the cube. There are a vast number of ways
                                                        of rotating the cube at any given point. If we make the correct set of decisions, at the end, the rubics cube will be 
                                                        in a state we want it to be, and we will have solved the rubics cube.
                                                     </p>

                                                     <p class="paragraphFontStyle">
                                                            There are a lot of problems that incorporate this type 
                                                            problem solving technique in which we're presented with the option of making a set of decisions on a given configuration.
                                                     </p>


                                                <p class="paragraphFontStyle"> 
                                                        This note will focus on decision making in how it relates to and is embedded
                                                        in a lot of problem solving questions. Each decision 
                                                        is intended to modify the configuration in some way. So, the state of a configuration will continously be changing
                                                        as long as decisions are applied on it. How the terms "making decisions" and "configuration" are defined
                                                        depends on the context of the problem. For the rubics cube example above, a particular state of a 'configuration' can be defined 
                                                        by the color of each cell on each face of a rubics cube at a time. At the end, however, the goal will be 
                                                        to analyse which combination of decisions led to a desired outcome for the configuration.
   
                                                     </p>
                                                     
                                                        <p class="paragraphFontStyle"> 
                                                            Decision making can manifest itself in a number of ways. A game of chess is another example that incorporates this type of
                                                            problem solving approach. At any point during the game, a player has to place any of the available chess pieces, and
                                                            each decision modifies the state of the configuration. A 'configuration' in this context can be the number of unplaced chess pieces and also
                                                            the chess board and the location of chess piece on the board.  So, every time a chess piece is placed on a board, the number of chess pieces on the board
                                                            is increased and the number of 'unplaced' chess pieces drops. So, there is a change in the state of the board. A much simpler variation of the game is the N-queens
                                                            problem. Given a 4*4 chess board, decide where to put 4 queens on the board so that none of the queens
                                                            attack each other.
                                                         </p>


                                                         <p class="paragraphFontStyle"> 
                                                                 Decision making spans problems much broader than just board games. Here's another situation: "Given an expression, such as "2*3+1", find all possible values the expression evalues to." To solve this,
                                                                 we have to decide how to parenthesize the expressions. we can parenthesize (2*3) first and then evaluate (6+1) which at the end would result in 7. These two decisions led to an outcome of 7. We can 
                                                                 also first parenthesize (3+1) and then (2*4) which would lead to 8. Again, the particular set of decisions made, let to a different outcome. Our goal is to find how many diffent outcomes we get by making
                                                                 sets of decisions. The initial configuration is "2*3+1". After one decision, the configuration may look like "(2*3) + 1" or the simplified version "6+1". After another decision is applied on the configuration, it would look like
                                                                 "(6+1)" or or just "7".
                                                        </p>

                                                        <p class="paragraphFontStyle"> 
                                                                Another example involves finding all subsets of a set. We have the original set which contains all the elements and then there is the subset. The goal here is to decide 
                                                                weather each element of the original set should go into the subset. For example, let's assume set A contains the following elements {1,2,3,4,5} and the following decisions are
                                                                made on each element of the set

                                                            left or right depending on the constraints set out by the problem. Let's see this in action by checking if a graph is bipartite graph. A graph is considered a bipartite
                                                            if it is possible to partition the vertices of the graph into two sets such that every edge in the graph connects a vertex from one set to a vertex from another set.
                                                            The 'configuration' for this problem will be the graph, and 'making a decision' merely means deciding which of the two sets a vertex goes into.

                                                                So while travesing the graph, for each

                                                     Let's dive a bit deeper into the first example. There are 4 queens and a 4x4 chess board, 
                                                     and the goal is to place the 4 queens on the board such that the queens do not attack each other. There are 
                                                     a number of ways this can happen, so let's find all of them.
                                                </p>

                                                <img src="../images/4-queen.png" style=" width: 30%;"/>

                                     


                                                <p class="paragraphFontStyle"> The first decision involves placing the first queen somewhere on the chess board - let's call this decision d1. There are sixteen
                                                        options for where the first queen can be placed on the board. Now, given the first decision is made, there are now 15 choices for
                                                        placing the second queen. After making 2 more successive decisions, all the four queens will be on the board. At this point, we can 
                                                        start to evaluate if the set of decisions made led to the intended outcome. This intended outcome is for the 4 queens on the board not to attack each other. If the queens attack each other,
                                                        we can undo the last decision, d4, and place the 4th queen somewhere else on the board. This would result in a different set of decisions than the one we originally made. 
                                                        We can continue to do this and enumerate all sets of decisions and only count the ones that lead us to the right configuration state.
                                                </p>

                                                    Recursion and Backtracking allow us to translate this exhaustive problem solving 
                                                    strategy into code. Everytime a recursive call is made on a given configuration(A board and the remaining queens in this case), 
                                                    some decision is about to be made on that board. This just means placing one of the remaining queens on any available cell on the board. 
                                                    Then, we recurse again on the new state of the board until we no longer have any queens to place. Once the base case of the recursion is reached(no unplaced queens left), 
                                                    the recursion will backtrack and slowly undo decisions and restore the board to its previous states. We can then explore other options by making new recursive calls.

                                                <p class="paragraphFontStyle"> There are a number of ways to optimize such type of decision making problems. One potential technique is called constraint programming. 
                                                        In constraint programming, the idea is to narrow down the number of decisions that could be made on the next state of a configuration based on what is known about the current 
                                                        state of a configuration.
                                                </p>

                                                <p class="paragraphFontStyle"> For example, if the first queen is placed on the top left corner of the chess board, the algorithm should avoid placing the next queen on any of 
                                                    the crossed out cells shown below since that will lead to the two queens attacking each other. In the context of the bipartite graph example above, if a decision is made to 
                                                    label a vertex into set 'A', for example, then none of its adjacent vertices should be in that set. If that is not possible, that means the graph is not bipartite. If we can go 
                                                    through all vertices of the graph having kept this constraint, then the graph is bipartite.

                                                      Sometimes, in decision making problems, we will encounter a configuration again in a state we have already decided on.
                                                       And we might be about to make the same set of decisions on that configuration. However, doing so would be redundant.
                                                      So, to optimize such situations, it would be better save the result of making a set of decisions on a particular state of a configuration.
                                                      Then, the next time the algorithm encounters the same state and is about to make the same set of decisions, it would know the the outcome
