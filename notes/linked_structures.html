                                                        A Linked structure refers to a structure that has some sort of recursive relationship
                                                         among its components (or nodes) as either a linearly linked structure, a tree structure or 
                                                         a graph structure.

                                                        In the above linear linked structure, an node is linked to a another node of the same type and so on. 
                                                        Linked structures can also be non-linear(trees or graphs):

                                                        Sometimes this relationship might not be obvious. In a game of chess for 
                                                        example, you can model the relationship between different states of a board 
                                                        as a linked structure. the same thing can be applied to the different states 
                                                        of a rubics cube. Every move made to transition the rubics cube from state 
                                                        A to state B links the two states. 
                                                </p>

                                                        So linked structures can manifest themselves in a number of ways in real life. 
                                                        So being able to traverse and manipulate these structures is important. There are 
                                                        generally two ways of traversing linked structures:

                                                        to visit each node in the order in which they are placed in the structure relative

                                                        performing a breadth-first search on that structure means visiting the nodes

                                                        '79' followed by node '46' at the end.

                                                        General implementation of Breadth first search traversals involve using data structures 
                                                        that provide operations that prioritize nodes closest to a starting node. For example, 
                                                        in most cases a queue data structure can be used to keep track of the order of nodes. 
                                                        In other situations, a priority queue can be used to prioritize nodes 'closest' to the 
                                                        starting point. Regardless of the choice of data structure, the general algorithm is the same:

                                                        The second way of traversing linked structure is depth first search. In this case, the
