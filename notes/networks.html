                                                <p class="paragraphFontStyle"> Networks are data structures that share lots of structural similarities to  graphs. 
                                                    Networks can structurally be thought of as weighted graphs and then some more. Each edge in a network has non-negative 
                                                    'flow' &  'capacity' weights.

                                                    Every network consists of a source and a sink(in some cases there  may be more than one source and sink). 
                                                    Sources will generate flow while sinks will drain the flow. Since networks represent closed systems, any 
                                                    flow that is generated by a source must be eventually drained via a sink. This is called the conservation 
                                                    of flow.

                                                    For example, if a network represents a water pipeline, the nodes of the network represent junctions(water pipe intersections),
                                                     edges represent pipes that connect the junctions, capacities may represent the maximum rate of water that can flow through a 
                                                     pipe, and flows will represent the actual rate of water flowing through a the pipe at a time. One common question associated 
                                                     with this problem may be "What is the max rate of water that can be pushed from the faucet to the sink given the water flow 
                                                     has to obey the capacity constraints. "

                                                    The term 'flow value' represents the overall amount of flow generated by every source in a network. Similarly, the term 
                                                    'maximum flow' represents the maximum 'flow value' possible given the capacity constraints of the network.

                                                </p>

                                                        So, what type of behaviors are commonly associated with networks? The two most common ones are <strong> 1.</strong>finding the 
                                                        value of the maximum flow within the network and <strong> 2. </strong>finding the 'Minimum cut' of a network. The 'minimum cut' 
                                                        represents a set of edges, with minimum overall capacity, that will disconnect the network(i.e flow from source 
                                                        to sink is not possible). These two might present themselves in different ways in real life problems. There is a 
                                                        very interesting theorem <a id="externalLink" href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr04/cos226/lectures/maxflow.4up.pdf"> max-flow min-cut </a> 
                                                        which basically says the value of these two quantities is equal. 
                                                </p>



                                                <p class="paragraphFontStyle"> 
                                                        Finding the maximum flow is basically an optimization problem: What should the amount of flow in each edge be so that the overall 
                                                        flow value is maximized. Due to this, a lot of real life problems can be reduced to and be represented using a network data structure.
                                                         Several combinatorial optimization problems that can be modeled by <a id="externalLink" href="bipartite_matching.html">bipartite graphs</a> and solved via bipartite matching algorithms can
                                                          be reduced to Network flow algorithms.  
                                                </p>

                                                <p class="paragraphFontStyle"> 
                                                        One of the main reasons why networks are powerful is because of the fact that there are known efficient algorithms for solving network flow 
                                                        problems. For example, the famous " 8 Queens" problem is usually solved via recursion & backtracking and possibly optimized via 
                                                        dynamic programming. Depending on the variation of the problem, this approach will solve the "8 Queens" problem in polynomial 
                                                        time. However, by eventually reducing this problem to a network flow problem, it can be solved in a time analogous to 
                                                        just a few iterations of depth first search/breadth first search. Another example of a problem that can be reduced to a flow network problem
                                                        is that of <a id="externalLink" href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ckingsf/bioinfo-lectures/edgedisjoint.pdf">edge-disjoint paths</a>

                                                        Most algorithms that solve network problems usually deal with a 
                                                        single source and a single sink. However, this won't be a problem
                                                         since such type of variations  that include more than one source

                                                    Given a residual network, one algorithm that solves for the max flow repeatedly attempts to find an augmenting
                                                    path. For each agumenting path the algorithm finds, it finds the edge along the path with the smallest residual capacity, and 
                                                    pushes that value as a flow to every edge along the augmenting path. The algorithm terminates when there is no longer an augmenting
                                                    path.
