The number on the tiles represent both their values and the order in which they must be placed onto a triangular board. The board has 21 spaces so one space remains uncovered. Once all the tiles have been placed, the tiles that surround the empty space are sucked into the black hole. The objective of the game is to have fewer points sucked into the black hole than then other player.",

		   paragraph4: "Although using minmax for the entire duration of the game will create the best computer player, this will consume an unreasonable amount of time. As a result, the approach used in this game is to use the monte-carlo approach until a certain depth is reach. Once that depth is reached, the minmax algorithm will be used to find the optimal move to make for the computer.",

A continental divide is a geographical term for the boundary which divides a continent into parts where each part leads to a different body of water. A clever way to think about a continental divide is to imagine rain pouring down on an entire continent. The water in each of the various parts made by the divide would flow to a different body of water. The application also handles situations where a part of a landmass will have water flow into a lake. For example, in Africa, the continental divide splits the continent in three parts, without assuming flow of water into lakes:",

It’s an algorithm that’s pretty good at generating realistic looking terrain. It works on a 2D array that’s 2n+1 square and will need to have the four corners of the original array to have a value set before it starts. The algorithm first sets the center point by averaging the four corner values and adding a small random amount of noise. This step is called the diamond step. The next step of the algorithm is set the four mid points between each corner. After recursively repeating the first two steps for each square that is formed, a realistic looking terrain will be generated.",

As a result it can have its own comprehensive unit test suite. Very limited unit tests were written for the project because we focused on application functionality.

	       paragraph1: "The goal of the program is to “teach” the computer to play the game 2048. There are two main approaches in terms of implementation. One approach is to use existing data to inform the decisions the computer makes. A dataset was constructed for the computer to use to make predictions of the best sets of moves necessary to score as highly as possible in 2048.",
		   paragraph2: "2048 is a game based on a 4x4 grid in which tiles may lie. The user must shift the tiles up, down, left, or right in an attempt to merge like adjacent tiles. After every move, a new tile spawns on the board. The goal is to prevent the board from becoming full.",
		   paragraph3: "The data collection was done by accumulating data of the moves made by a human user. This was done by playing the game for a couple of weeks. After a key is pressed by the user, the pressed key is recorded, as well as the current state of the board.  ",
		   paragraph4: "In order to obtain the best results, it was necessary to make the data as varied as possible. This was naturally hard to achieve due to the fact that a human player usually plays with a very specific pattern which means that a narrow set of scenarios would be considered. To resolve this issue,  a system of randomized games was also set up in addition to the regular full games. This is achieved by resetting the game with a random set of tiles in random locations to force data for different scenarios to be represented in the data set.",
		   ProjectSubtitle3: "Model selection",
		   paragraph5: "The state of each tile on the board served as features and the goal was to perform a multinomial classification in order to predict the key that needed to be pressed in order to progress to the following state. Two machine learning algorithms were implemented to achieve this: Perceptron and K Nearest Neighbors.",
		   paragraph6: "A random simulation of the game was used as a baseline for the rest of the prediction algorithms. The average score of a random simulation of the game was 1104 with a maximum score of 3048, after 100 iterations.",
		   ProjectSubtitle5: "Perceptron",
		   paragraph7: "The first class prediction algorithm implemented is the perceptron algorithm. This algorithm uses a set of weights that it adjusts based on the data set to best separate the classes. This algorithm has a drawback for this specific program. One minor drawback of perceptron for this specific situation was the fact that it only tells us which class was the most likey but does not tell us anything about the likelihood of the other classes. This can cause the computer to be stuck in situations where the predicted move is one that the computer cannot make because due to the placement of the tiles. In situations like that, a random move is selected. This surely contributed to the lower accuracy of the algorithm. The average score of a perceptron based computer player is 1330 with the maximum score being 3184 after 100 simulations.",
		   ProjectSubtitle6: "KNN",
		   paragraph8: "The other class prediction algorithm implemented was the k-nearest neighbors classifier. This classifier predicts classes by comparing the features to prior features from the data set, and choosing the most frequent class in the set of k-nearest neighbors. The benefit of using k-nearest to make multinomial classification such as this one is it provides probabilities for all classes. This way, in situations where the class with the highest probability is an impossible move, the next most probable move will be used. This should give strong results in the analysis. The average score of a KNN based computer player is 2211 with a maximum score is 6184 after 100 simulations.",

		   paragraph8: "The WordNet class allows for rapid queries after reading input files and storing them in the ADT. WordNet is a semantic lexicon for the English language that is used extensively by computational linguists and cognitive scientists; for example, it was a key component in IBM's Watson. WordNet groups words into sets of synonyms called synsets and describes semantic relationships between them. One such relationship is the is-a relationship, which connects a hyponym (more specific synset) to a hypernym (more general synset). For example, 'change' is a hypernym of 'demotion', since 'demotion' is-a (type of) 'change'. 'change' is in turn a hyponym of 'action', since 'change' is-a (type of) 'action'. A visual depiction of some hyponym relationships in English is given below:",
		   ModalSubImage8: "wordnetsysnets.png",
    	   paragraph9: "Synsets consist of one or more words in English that all have the same meaning. For example, one synset is 'jump, parachuting', which represents the act of descending to the ground with a parachute. 'jump, parachuting' is a hyponym of 'descent', since 'jump, parachuting' is-a 'descent'.",
		   paragraph10: "Words in English may belong to multiple synsets. This is just another way of saying words may have multiple meanings. For example, the word jump also belongs to the synset ‘‘jump, leap’, which represents the more figurative notion of jumping (e.g. a jump in attendance). The hypernym of the synset ‘jump, leap’ is ‘increase’, since ‘jump, leap’ is-an ‘increase’. Of course, there are other ways to ‘increase’ something, for example, through ‘augmentation,’ and thus it is no surprise that we have an arrow pointing downwards from ‘increase’ to ‘augmentation’ in the diagram above.",
		   paragraph11: "Synsets may include not just words, but also what are known as collocations. You can think of these as single words that occur next to each other so often that they are considered a single word, e.g. nasal_decongestant. To avoid ambiguity, we will represent the constitutent words of collocations as being separated with an underscore _ instead of the usual convention in English of separating them with spaces. For simplicity, we will refer to collocations as simply 'words' throughout this document.",
		   paragraph12: "A synset may be a hyponym of multiple synsets. For example, 'actifed' is a hyponym of both 'antihistamine' and 'nasal_decongestant', since 'actifed' is both of these things. The relationship is represented by a graph",
		   paragraph13: "There are two data files that you used to create the wordnet digraph. The files are in CSV format: each line contains a sequence of fields, separated by commas. The file synsets.txt consists of synsets in WordNet. The first field is the synset id (an integer), the second field is the synonym set (or synset), and the third field is its dictionary definition (or gloss). ",
		   paragraph14: "The file hyponyms.txt (and other smaller files with hyponym in the name) contains the hyponym relationships: The first field is a synset id; subsequent fields are the id numbers of the synset's direct hyponyms.",
		   paragraph15: "After analyzing the NGram dataset, the program provides a visualized answer to questions such as the relative popularity of words over time, the relative popularity of categories of words, the hyponyms of a given word, and the length of words.",
		   paragraph16: "The following plot shows shows the relative popularity of the words cake and pie from the period 1900 to 1930:",
		   ModalSubImage16: "ngordnetCakePieChart.png",
		   paragraph17: "The program also provides a visualization to Zipf’s law. Zipf’s law states that the frequency of words in English is inversely proportional to the rank.

This is mainly achieved by modularizing our code and using various principles such as dependency inversion, open-closed principle and single responsibility principles. Various design patterns have also been used to represent repeated design elements. The three layers used in the design of the program are the service layer, domain layer, and data access layer. The service layer is a structure built using Java and CXF running on Apache’s tomcat server. The domain layer is written in java and uses ReactiveX Java to manage asynchronous tasks and uses spring to manage dependency injection. This makes testing easier and minimizes code modifications when adding new features. The data access layer uses hibernate to persist objects into a MySQL database server. At various stages in the design process, we were iteratively modifying our designs. ",
